# Django-Play-With-Text

Welcome to Play With Text!

Play with text is a simple django based web application which I made for fun so that user can do anything with his text (i.e remove punctuations, turn uppercase, count word, remove new line, remove extra space, remove number from sentence), I have added another new function
which I called fun with math, I used a third party api so that user can create a graph from any quadratic equation with point labels. 
You can contact with me through this website, I have added so many ways to contact with me. You can check that out.
